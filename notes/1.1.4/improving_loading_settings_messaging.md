### Improvements

Now when loading a project that has multiple build.sbt files the logger shows the path as well.
Before it was:

```bash
[info] Loading settings from build.sbt ...
[info] Loading settings from build.sbt ...
[info] Loading settings from build.sbt ...
[info] Loading settings from build.sbt ...
```

Now it's:

```bash
[info] Loading settings from /home/user/Work/personal/someProject/build.sbt ...
[info] Loading settings from /home/user/Work/personal/someProject/subProject1/build.sbt ...
[info] Loading settings from /home/user/Work/personal/someProject/subProject2/build.sbt ...
[info] Loading settings from /home/user/Work/personal/someProject/subProject3/build.sbt ...
```

This should solve the issue: https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3607
