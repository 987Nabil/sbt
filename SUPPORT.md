Support
=======

[Lightbend] sponsors sbt and encourages contributions from the active community. Enterprises can adopt it for mission critical systems with confidence because Lightbend stands behind sbt with commercial support and services.

For community support please [ask] on StackOverflow with the tag "sbt" (and the name of the sbt plugin(s) if any).

- State the problem or question clearly and provide enough context. Code examples and `build.sbt` are often useful when appropriately edited.
- There's also [Gitter sbt/sbt room][gitter], but Stackoverflow is recommended so others can benefit from the answers.

For professional support, for instance if you need faster response times, [Lightbend], the maintainer of Scala compiler and sbt, provides:

- [Lightbend Subscriptions][subscriptions], which includes Expert Support
- Training
- Consulting
